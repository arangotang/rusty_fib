# Rusty Fib
This is my second rust app to date. Like my last project, this also runs on the command line.

### Features
- Finds the *n*th fibonacci number given a user-inputted number, *n*.
- Suffix for the *nth* term dynamically adjusts to input

```
  nth fibonacci, please enter n:
  $ 12
  12th fibonacci is 89
```
